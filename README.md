## Introduction

Blockchain explorer is a fundamental part of 2030 project. It will allow token holders to have real time, accurate and verifiable information about the current holdings of CriptX tokens.

For more information on CryptX refer to [Token Factory Website](http://tokenfactory.io) and the [20|30 Website](http://www.2030.io)

## Development Components and Phases

There are two parts in BlockChain Explorer:
1. The **Back-End** that allows to access programatically information about 20|30 CryptX token holdings
2. The **BlockChain Explorer** user interface that allows to see coins and smart contracts

We have a few phases, (** by priority? ** )

 1. Provide an interface Input a list of blockchains and addresses, get values out to display on our site.

 2. Create a more full-service blockchain API that we can sell to mostly corporate buyers. Tailor it to their needs.

 3. Create a cool explorer interface everyone can use to see all the coins and all the smart contracts.

## Technology Stack and Resources

Back-end will be written Clojure, possibly extending or merging with an existing project. The Explorer uses ClojureScript ( **do we have a repository to link to from here?**)

Therefore we are currently need the following following expertise/Resources:

* Clojure for the back-end
* ClojureScript for the front-end
* Front-end devs (CSS, etc)
* ~~UX designer for exchange and wallet and explorer~~
